# Explaination

- The problem is represented as a sequence of folder navigation commands in the form of a vector of strings logs.
- The navigation commands can be one of three types:
    - ../: Move up one folder level (i.e., go to the parent folder).
    - ./: Stay in the current folder (i.e., do nothing).
    - Any other string: Move down one folder level into a subfolder with the given name.
- The goal is to find the minimum number of operations required to navigate to the main folder (i.e., the root folder) from the current folder.

The solution uses a single integer variable position to keep track of the current folder level. The initial value of position is 0, which represents the main folder.

The solution iterates through each command in the logs vector and updates the position variable accordingly:

- If the command is ../, it means we need to move up one folder level. If we're not already in the main folder (i.e., position != 0), we decrement position by 1.
- If the command is ./, we do nothing and stay in the current folder.
- If the command is any other string, it means we need to move down one folder level into a subfolder. We increment position by 1.

Finally, the solution returns the absolute value of position, which represents the minimum number of operations required to navigate to the main folder from the current folder.

For example, if the input logs is ["d1/","d2/","../","../","./"], the solution would iterate through the commands as follows:

- d1/: position becomes 1.
- d2/: position becomes 2.
- ../: position becomes 1.
- ../: position becomes 0.
- ./: no change, position remains 0.

The final value of position is 0, which means we're already in the main folder. The solution returns abs(0) = 0, indicating that no operations are required to navigate to the main folder.
