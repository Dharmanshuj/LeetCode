# Explaination
### Here's a step-by-step explanation:

- int n = nums.size();: This line gets the size of the input vector nums and stores it in the variable n.

- if(n <= 4) return 0;: This is a base case. If the size of the input vector is less than or equal to 4, the function returns 0. This is because the problem statement asks for the minimum difference between the maximum and minimum values in a subset of 4 elements, and if the input vector has 4 or fewer elements, the minimum difference is 0.

- sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());: This line sorts the input vector nums in ascending order.

- int diff = nums[n-1] - nums[0];: This line calculates the initial difference between the maximum and minimum values in the sorted vector. The maximum value is at the end of the sorted vector (nums[n-1]), and the minimum value is at the beginning (nums[0]).

- The for loop iterates 4 times:

  - for(int i=0; i<4; i++): This loop iterates over the first 4 elements of the sorted vector.
  - diff = min(diff, nums[n-4+i] - nums[i]);: In each iteration, it calculates the difference between the maximum value in the current subset of 4 elements (nums[n-4+i]) and the minimum value in the current subset (nums[i]). It then updates diff with the minimum of the current diff and the newly calculated difference.
- return diff;: Finally, the function returns the minimum difference found.
