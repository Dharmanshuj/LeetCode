## Class Solution

- The code defines a class Solution with two methods: binary and intersect.

## Method binary

- The binary method is a recursive function that performs a binary search on a sorted vector nums to find a specific value. The method takes four parameters:

  - nums: the sorted vector to search
  - value: the value to search for
  - start: the starting index of the search range
  - end: the ending index of the search range

- The method returns a boolean value indicating whether the value was found in the nums vector.

**Here's what the method does:**

- If start is greater than end or if the nums vector is empty, the method returns false, indicating that the value was not found.
- The method calculates the midpoint mid of the search range using the formula start + (end - start) / 2.
- If the element at index mid in nums is equal to value, the method erases the element from the vector using nums.erase(nums.begin() + mid) and returns true.
- If the element at index mid is greater than value, the method recursively calls itself with the search range reduced to start to mid-1.
- If the element at index mid is less than value, the method recursively calls itself with the search range reduced to mid+1 to end.

## Method intersect

- The intersect method takes two vectors nums1 and nums2 as input and returns a vector containing the intersection of the two input vectors.

**Here's what the method does:**

- If either nums1 or nums2 is empty, the method returns an empty vector.
- The method creates a vector result to store the intersection of the two input vectors.
- The method sorts nums1 in ascending order using sort(nums1.begin(), nums1.end()).
- The method iterates over each element i in nums2 and calls the binary method to search for i in nums1. If the binary method returns true, it means that i is present in nums1, and the method adds i to the result vector.
- Finally, the method returns the result vector containing the intersection of the two input vectors.

The idea behind this solution is to use binary search to find each element of nums2 in nums1. If an element is found, it is added to the result vector. The time complexity of this solution is O(n log m), where n is the size of nums2 and m is the size of nums1.
